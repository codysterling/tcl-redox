# ChemShell protocol for calculation of aqueous redox potentials

This is the code for the protocol discussed in:
[Cody M. Sterling and Ragnar Bjornsson.  Multistep Explicit Solvation Protocol for Calculation of Redox Potentials.  *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation.* **2019**, *15*(1), 52--67.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00982)

This code was developed for use with ChemShell TCL version 3.7.  This is now deprecated, and replaced with Py-ChemShell.
